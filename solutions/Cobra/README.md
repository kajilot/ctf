## Description

Doctor P. Cobra is a vetarn lecturer at the Texas Cyber University. He is also a principal cyber specailist at Palo Alto Networks, and he loves snakes!
He programmed a unique system in order to manage his university students. He absolutly loves the system, but it has one problem: it dosent support multiple users.
Thats a problem because sometimes non-students need to access the system as well.
To solve this issue the doctor used his cyber skills to write an extra-super-sophisticated cyber web application. This application allows him to authorise all users. Probelm solved. 

Or is it? 

The system can be accessed at http://\<IP\>/public. 

Can you get the flag before piza arrives?
